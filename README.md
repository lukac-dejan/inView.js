inView.js
=========

This is a jQuery function which allows us to quickly check if an element 
is within the browsers visual viewport (window object).


Documentation
-------------
inView.js is a function that allows you to select element or group of elements on a web page and track their visibility as you scroll or resize the page. 

Since this is a simple plugin, the usage is simple too.
First, add the inView.js to your document along with jQuery library:

`<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.2.4/jquery.min.js"></script>`

`<script type="text/javascript" src="_js/jquery.inView.js"></script>`

After that all you need to do is assign a class named **_.trackInView_** to all of the elements on the page that you want to track. Once it's done, inView.js will execute on every onresize and onscroll event and assign class named **_.inView_** if the element is in the viewport or **_.notInView_** if it's not. 


Limitations
-----------

This function will consider elementâ€™s position and dimensions, compared to dimension and scroll position of window. It will NOT check if the element is hidden using css, or positioned behind another object using z-index.
